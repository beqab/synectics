                hink of server virtualization as the dividing and conquering of
                one master server. By moving all operations from one, large
                server to a number of smaller ones, a company becomes more
                agile. Each of these virtual servers can run its own operating
                system, so there is no need to base all of a companyâ€™s software
                on the pre-existing operating system of an existing, central
                server. Additionally, server virtualization reduces overhead
                costs and downtime of servers by making more efficient use of
                space and cooling down more quickly and easily.

                The world of technology is continuously evolving, from the rise
                in the Internet of Things (IoT) through the adoption of Software
                as a Service (SaaS) over traditional in-house applications. And
                as technologies shift, so does the threat landscape. Yet many
                organizations adapt their technology without guidance or
                direction from IT, information security, procurement, or risk
                specialists. <br />
                As a Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP), we act as our
                clientâ€™s trusted go-to partner bringing advanced expertise in
                the current threat landscape. Let us become an extension of your
                team, whether seeking assistance with 24x7 network security

                As multi-vendor deployments are becoming the norm; unceasing
                production of log, flow and machine data are becoming available.
                The ability to obtain actionable intelligence from this data
                represents a tremendous opportunity for businesses. Of course,
                companies will require the ability to collect, analyze,
                visualize and respond to this data in real-time in order to
                realize the full benefits. Otherwise, the information and trend
                intelligence captured will simply be wasted. With the risk of
                extended outages, slower time to resolution and excessive
                downtimes, the stakes are high. <br />
                Many IT organizations have invested in costly software solutions
                to collect, analyze and visualize infrastructure data.
                Unfortunately purchasing the latest monitoring software does not
                automatically guarantee success.
